# AWS-CDK-Packages
The AWS Solutions Constructs library is an open-source extension of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) that provides multi-service, well-architected patterns for quickly defining solutions in code to create predictable and repeatable infrastructure. The goal of AWS Solutions Constructs is to accelerate the experience for developers to build solutions of any size using pattern-based definitions for their architecture.
